Create a prediction model based on Praiano's Tunes and see if we can create a baseline for tunes based on the data we have.
This is not to replace manual tuning, but rather a fun experiment to see possibilities and limitations of machine learning
when it comes to tuning setups.

Initially we can seperate between these groups:
- Racing Car Groups (Gr.1, Gr.2, Gr.3, Gr.4, Gr.B)
- Road Car Groups (N100, N200, N300, N400, N500, N600, N700, N800, N900)

We might also want to check them all together to see if there is a difference between how the groups are created.


So we will need to differentiate between input values by the user and the output values that we want to predict.

//TODO: SEE TUNE SCREEN FOR INPUT VALUES / OUTPUT VALUES
### Input values
- Tyres (?)
- Aero Values
- Max Powerd
- Max Torque
- Displacement
- Weight
- Front-Rear Weight Balance

### Output values

## Suspension
- Body Height Adjustment (Front/Rear)
- Anti Roll Bar (Front/Rear)
- Damping Ratio (Compression) (Front/Rear)
- Damping Ratio (Expansion) (Front/Rear)
- Natural Frequency (Front/Rear)
- Negative Camber Angle (Front/Rear)
- Toe Angle (Front/Rear)

## Differential ** Front only for 4WD **
- Initial Torque (Front/Rear)
- Acceleration Sensitivity (Front/Rear)
- Braking Sensitivity (Front/Rear)

Required Translations:
- HP -> BHP         (1 HP = 0.986 BHP)
- ft-lb -> kgfm     (1 ft-lb = 0.13825 kgfm)
- lbs -> kg         (1 lbs = 0.45359 kg)
